          .feature
            p juggler depends on 
              a(href='http://gruntjs.com/', target='_blank') grunt.js
              |Â  as task runner and 
              a(href='http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding', target='_blank') grunt-init
              |  for template scaffolding:
            pre
              code
                |npm install -g grunt-cli
                |npm install -g grunt-init

      .row-fluid 
        .span4
          h4.feature-title Add template to grunt-init:
        .span8
          .feature
            pre
              code
                |git clone git://github.com/jamuhl/juggler-init-demo.git ~/.grunt-init/juggler-demo

            p Right now we provide only the demo template - other templates will follow.

      .row-fluid 
        .span4
          h4.feature-title Create a new project:
        .span8
          .feature
            pre
              code
                |mkdir myapp
                |cd myapp
                |// init juggler project template
                |grunt-init juggler-demo
                |// -> for now you will need to set path and projectname in Gruntfile.js file
      
      .row-fluid 
        .span4
          h4.feature-title Add a device:
        .span8
          .feature
            pre
              code
                |// create iOS phonegap application
                |grunt iOS:create
                |// build webapp
                |grunt iOS:build
                |// start iOS emulator (brew install ios-sim -- to use sim from commandline)
                |grunt iOS:emulate

            p To develop for Android just use same commands for android, eg: 
              code grunt android:create
